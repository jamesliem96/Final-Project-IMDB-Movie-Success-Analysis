# Final-Project-IMDB-Movie-Success-Analysis
This project is about analyzing movies using its imdb score as a success measure with many types of analysis. This analysis includes regression, classification, clustering, and correlation analysis. I also performed many visualizations to get general findings. The goal of this project is to find the best predictive model that is accurate to predict a movie's success, the interesting facts regarding successful movies and to find which variables are important and have significant effect to the imdb score.
